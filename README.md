## Project Overview
The **Heart Health Risk Assessment System** is a professional healthcare analytics application designed to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease based on clinical parameters. This project focuses on leveraging supervised machine learning to provide clinicians with early-warning risk assessments, enabling data-driven patient care.

### Core Objectives
- **Automated Screening:** Rapidly assess patient risk using standard clinical metrics.
- **Explainable AI:** Provide clear insights into key risk factors contributing to the assessment.
- **Clinical Efficiency:** Streamline the diagnostic workflow through a high-performance interactive interface.

## System Architecture & ML Pipeline
The system implements a structured medical data pipeline to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.

### 1. Data Processing
- **Input Handling:** Captures 13 critical clinical features through a validated UI.
- **Normalization:** Employs a **StandardScaler** to ensure all features (e.g., Blood Pressure, Cholesterol) are processed on a uniform scale, preventing bias toward high-magnitude features.

### 2. Model Logic
- **Algorithm:** **Logistic Regression** was selected for its balance of high accuracy and clinical interpretability.
- **Inference Process:** 
  1. The pre-trained model loads serialized weights from `logistic_model.pkl`.
  2. The input vector is transformed using the fitted scaler.
  3. The model calculates the risk probability using the sigmoid function, outputting a risk score and categorical classification (HIGH/LOW).

## Input-Output Specifications

### Clinical Inputs
| Category | Parameters |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Demographics** | Age, Biological Sex |
